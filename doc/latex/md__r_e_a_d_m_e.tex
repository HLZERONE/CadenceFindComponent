Modern day electronic systems are complex and house many gates and components. These components are then connected according to the system architecture and interconnect specifications. Often in various aspects of electronic design automation, we are faced with identifying or matching a subset of such components from the huge sea of components. In other words, if we represent the whole electronic system as a graph, there is often a need to finding a matching sub-\/graph according to some design constraints.

The requirement for this project is as follows. Given a system graph SG with N nodes where nodes and edges have special attributes and a query graph QG with M nodes (where M \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}= N), find a set of matching result graphs RG with M nodes each, where each RG matches QG. For simplicity, we can assume each node has 2 attributes – resource factor R (1 \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}= R \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}= 8) and density factor D (1 \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}= D \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}= 16). Each edge has one attribute that represents delay DE (where DE can have one of 3 values 10, 100, 1000).
